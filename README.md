Backbone.Beamer
===============
Beamer is a "platform" for developing extensions for Backbone's prototypes (View, Model, Collection, Router).
Its purpose is to ease hooking to backbone's prototypes methods - "initialize", "render" etc and make the extension easier for developers.

Above all, Beamer is an Extension Manager &amp; Loader for Backbone.js

head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/orizens/Backbone.Beamer/wiki/Extensions) for all available extensions.
